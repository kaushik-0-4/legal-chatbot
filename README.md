This project aims to develop a Web Application that serves as a comprehensive legal assistant. The primary goal is to make legal resources and expertise accessible to everyone, whether they are legal professionals or members of the general public. By democratizing legal knowledge, the application seeks to dismantle barriers to justice and create an ecosystem where legal assistance is sophisticated, accessible, and efficient for all users.
